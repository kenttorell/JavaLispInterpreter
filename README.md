# JavaLispInterpreter

A barebones LISP interpreter written by Kent Torell in Java 8 for UNC's Comp 992 with Prasun Dewan as an advisor.
This project is meant to be used as the scaffolding for Dr. Dewan's future "Programming Languages" assignments.
Included are both a lazy and a non-lazy interpreter.  Future work will combine the two into the same program, triggered with a command line flag.
